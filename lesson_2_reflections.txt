What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A folder called .git is added to the directory. This contains metadata about
the other content in the directory. No intial commit is made

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository. It allows
the programmer to commit several files, although not necessarily all the files in the
working directory to the repository in one commit
